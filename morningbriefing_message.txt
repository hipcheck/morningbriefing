    - rirze: Love how he put a paragraph for someone asking, "why not generate Rust?". Beautiful.
      https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46945932
  Article summary:
    The author (a compiler engineer) shares practical patterns for compilers that emit C as a target language. The main theme: use C in a way that keeps semantics explicit and lets the C compiler erase abstraction costs (e.g., `static inline` + `always_inline` helpers for accessors and conversions).

    Key tips include avoiding implicit integer conversions (turn on `-Wconversion` and funnel casts through typed helpers), wrapping raw pointers/integers in single-field structs to encode intent and prevent category mistakes, and not being afraid of `memcpy` for unaligned loads/stores. For tricky ABIs/tail calls and many-arg functions, the suggestion is to do some manual register allocation (e.g., spill “extra” args/returns into globals) rather than betting on the compiler.

    The post closes with why generating C is a sweet spot (mature codegen + linking + inlining) and what you give up (stack control, precise stack scanning, zero-cost exception side tables, source-level debugging). It also addresses “why not Rust?”: lifetimes are largely a frontend problem, and Rust’s tail-call/toolchain story can be a wash for generated code.

      https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46945896
  Article summary:
    Promethee is a tiny UEFI environment that lets you write boot-time logic in JavaScript. On boot, it loads `script.js` from the boot volume and executes it—your JS becomes the bootloader.

    It exposes UEFI services (e.g., GOP graphics) as JS bindings, so anything you can do via UEFI protocols can, in principle, be scripted. The repo includes a quick-start to build and run in QEMU and shows small examples like drawing to the framebuffer.

    The practical takeaway: it’s a playful “dominance over the machine” project—useful for experimentation, demos, and learning UEFI/boot internals via a friendlier language than C, with the obvious caveat that you’re still constrained by UEFI’s world (drivers/protocols you have available at boot).

      https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46945845
  Article summary:
    A New Yorker feature on growing evidence that GLP‑1 drugs (e.g., semaglutide/Ozempic) may reduce cravings beyond food—potentially affecting alcohol, nicotine, opioids, and other addictions. It opens with a case study of a long-time heavy drinker in a blinded semaglutide trial who describes “alcohol noise” disappearing, enabling broader life changes.

    Researchers frame addiction partly as reward-circuit salience and craving signatures in the brain; GLP‑1 receptors are present in key reward regions, and prolonged receptor activation from these meds may dampen cue-reactivity. Observational studies and early trials suggest meaningful reductions in harmful use or overdose risk, motivating broader clinical testing.

    The article also stresses tradeoffs: some participants experience profound appetite suppression, nausea, and rapid weight loss, which can be distressing or medically risky. The optimistic view is that GLP‑1s could offer a private, at-home medication option for addiction, potentially pointing to more universal mechanisms across substance and behavioral addictions.

    We're Tom and Ryan and we teamed up to build an algorithm with Rust and SIMD to exhaustively search for the longest line of sight on the planet. We can confirm that a previously speculated view between Pik Dankova in Kyrgyzstan and the Hindu Kush in China is indeed the longest, at 530km.We go into all the details at https://alltheviews.worldAnd there's an interactive map with over 1 billion longest lines, covering the whole world at https://map.alltheviews.world Just click on any point and it'll load its longest line of sight.Some of you may remember Tom's post[1] from a few months ago about how to efficiently pack visibility tiles for computing the entire planet. Well now it's done. The compute run itself took 100s of AMD Turin cores, 100s of GBs of RAM, a few TBs of disk and 2 days of constant runtime on multiple machines.If you are interested in the technical details, Ryan and I have written extensively about the algorithm and pipeline that got us here:* Tom's blog post: https://tombh.co.uk/longest-line-of-sight* Ryan's technical breakdown: https://ryan.berge.rs/posts/total-viewshed-algorithmThis was a labor of love and we hope it inspires you both technically and naturally, to get you out seeing some of these vast views for yourselves!1. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45485227

  Article summary:
    Two builders report an exhaustive, planet-scale computation of the longest line of sight on Earth. Using a custom Rust + SIMD pipeline and precomputed visibility tiles, they claim to confirm the oft-speculated record view: roughly 530 km from the Hindu Kush to Pik Dankova (Kyrgyzstan/China region).

    They publish both a narrative explanation and an interactive map with billions of “longest lines” you can click through. The compute run is described as substantial (hundreds of cores, hundreds of GB RAM, TBs of disk) over multiple machines for ~2 days.

    Beyond the headline number, the interesting part is the method/pipeline for doing global viewshed-style queries at massive scale, and the productized result: a browsable atlas of extreme sightlines rather than a one-off calculation.

    I'm launching Wirewiki.com today!Wirewiki makes the internet’s hidden infrastructure browsable.I quit my job 5 years ago to scale Nslookup.io. But after reaching 600k monthly users, I hit a ceiling. I couldn't naturally expand beyond DNS because of the domain name.So I went back to the drawing board: how would I make it today? Not as a collection of tools, but as a browsable graph.I've spent hundreds of hours and commits building that. It's not even at 10% of what I want it to be, but more than enough to be useful, and (in my biased opinion) much better than what's out there.Wirewiki launches with DNS lookup, propagation, zone transfer and SPF checking. It also scans the entire IPv4 space for DNS servers and indexes them.
I'm working on adding more data and tools.I feel like I've developed tunnel vision, so if you see anything that feels off, let me know!I'll keep Wirewiki open and free. Once it has a substantial amount of users, I'll open it up to sponsorship / brand integration from hosting providers, registrars and CDNs, as users will likely be in the market for those. But my goal is to keep Wirewiki free from display ads. I'm confident that's viable.

  Article summary:
    Wirewiki is a new “browse the internet’s infrastructure” site: instead of isolated lookup tools, it aims to make DNS/IP-related data feel like a navigable graph. The launch includes DNS lookup + propagation checking + zone-transfer checks + SPF tooling, plus an index of discovered DNS servers from scanning the IPv4 space.

    The creator’s backstory: they previously built Nslookup.io (hit product/brand constraints) and rebuilt from scratch with a broader concept and UX. The stated ambition is to keep it free and expand coverage and tools over time.

    Near-term value: a nicely-packaged entry point for exploring domain/DNS relationships quickly; long-term value depends on how much richer the graph becomes (e.g., ASN/provider mapping, hosting/CDN ties, change history, security posture), which commenters also nudge toward.

      Background:
      I was browsing reddit, twitter excessively for very long hours and not doing much once I was back from work. I planned on cutting it off as its was feeding so much negativity to my head and add something else to fill that time.
      I wrap work around 7 PM and have dinner by 8 PM. I have about 7-8 hours after this for myself as I usually sleep late around 3-4 AM. My goal is to get to a point where I sleep by 12-1 at max, a topic for another day!
      I intended to use that time to upskill/work on side projects. My concern was that even with this 7-8 hours, I will be able to study for 2-3 hours at max as cognitive fatigue is real after work and few hours of study. I had no idea how was gonna fill the remaining ~4 hours
      How it turned out?
 One week into this and the effects are massive. Surprisingly, negative too!!
      I’ve been able to redcuce doom scrolling over the past week (R… (truncated)

      - /u/Jazzlike_Key_8556: Super relatable. Call a friend, see a partner, have dinner with family, or even just sit in a café where others are around. Being around people naturally pulls you into their pace and gets you out of your own head without needing mental effort.

      Let’s talk about the moment you realized: “yeah…my WHOOP was right.”
      Not the polished ones. The real ones.
      The red recovery you ignored… and regretted
      The sleep score you gaslit yourself about
      The lifestyle choice you thought was harmless (it was not)
      Drop your story below. Maybe the WHOOP admins will share theirs 👀

      - /u/twogoogles: The one everyone probably figured out, alcohol. I knew obviously after having a good night with alcohol that I was not getting the best sleep and that the next day would be rough. What I think I was more surprised about was how long it took my body…

      Three weeks in. This is where habits stop feeling shiny and start feeling real.
      By now, your plan isn’t exciting; it’s inconvenient. This is the point where most people loosen standards, start negotiating with themselves, or quietly stop checking in.
      So let’s be honest.
      Did you do what you said you would? If not, did you adjust — or just drift? What held up under pressure? What broke when life got busy? No excuses needed. Just accountability.
      Maybe your data surprised you. Maybe you missed a few days and got back on track anyway. That still counts.
      Drop your Week 3 update below and share what helped you stay consistent this week. Use this space to trade ideas, normalize the messy parts, and encourage someone else who’s showing up alongside you.
      Every check-in = an entry to win a free WHOOP band. And your comment might be exactly what someone else needs to make it to the final… (truncated)

      I really need to figure out what’s going on with my sleep. I’ve changed my wind down. Method started adding supplements like magnesium and L-theanine.
      Logging my electrolyte and hydration levels.
      But for some reason, I’ll go to bed wake up a couple of hours later and I’m wide awake for the next two or three hours then I’ll come back to bed and sleep.
      Or, my body is dog ass tired and as soon as my head hits the pillow, my mind is like nope, I’m not tired at all. Let’s start thinking of any and every random ass thing!
