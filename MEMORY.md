# MEMORY.md

## Preferences
- Proactively message about health metrics when something notable occurs: single-day extremes (highest/lowest vs recent months) and sustained changes (5–7 day trend shifts).
- Memory capture: I proactively save relevant stable preferences/decisions/system setups into this file. Messages prefixed with "Remember:" are always saved (failsafe).
- Health logging: proactively add interesting observations/insights from Oura/WHOOP into Obsidian (not just raw numbers). Default location: daily note → crystallized thought.
- Job search scan: prioritize official company job pages (Amazon/Apple/Google), but still include standout roles from other companies if they strongly match preferences.
- “Morning briefing” (default meaning): the scheduled daily briefing, published as a blog-style post (GitHub Pages) with a Slack link posted in <#C0ADV68FD2Q>. Default schedule: daily 7:50am ET.
- Readwise personalization: use ALL highlights to learn interests and add an “anti-bubble” recommendations section to the morning briefing (no red lines).

## Readwise-derived interest profile (for recommendations)
- Format bias: highlights heavily skew to audio/longform (Snipd dominates), then Kindle + Reader.
- High-signal recurring themes: self-improvement + mindset frameworks; biohacking/longevity/performance (sleep/energy/body/brain); consciousness/"reality"/metacognition; leadership/strategy/goal pursuit.
- Representative sources (not exhaustive): Huberman Lab, Tim Ferriss, Dave Asprey/Human Upgrade, Jim Rohn-style material, Mindset That Matters/A Changed Mind.
- Bubble-escape intent: recommendations should deliberately diversify domains/sources and include adjacent + wildcard items, not only the usual tech/Reddit feeds.

## Systems
- Obsidian vault: "Brain" at /Users/andreasallmaier/Documents/Brain.
- Idea capture: `inbox/Idea Inbox.md` (ideas sent in chat get appended here; daily notes can reference the capture).
- Oura → Obsidian: daily import at 7:30 AM ET (anchor to America/New_York), writing key sleep metrics into the journal.
