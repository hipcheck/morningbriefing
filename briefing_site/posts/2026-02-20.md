## B) Reddit — Top topics (summarized)

Pulled from a handful of big subreddits via RSS (r/technology, r/worldnews, r/science, r/programming, r/Futurology). Themes below (with representative threads):

- **“AI washing” layoffs & attribution games:** discussion about companies blaming workforce reductions on AI whether or not AI is the real driver.
- **Wearables + courts:** as Meta’s trial unfolds, debate about smart glasses in courtrooms and what counts as recording/obstruction.
- **UK/US/Iran basing politics:** discussion of the UK reportedly declining use of RAF bases for strikes, and what that implies for alliance leverage.
- **Universal respiratory vaccine (nasal spray):** excitement and skepticism around claims of broad protection across viruses/bacteria/allergens (in mice, for months).
- **AI agents in the wild:** threads on an outage blamed on an AI coding bot, and a separate story about an “AI agent” writing a hit piece (plus the operator coming forward).
- **Long-horizon storage:** fascination with “robot libraries” and ultra-long-lived storage mediums.
