## A) Hacker News — Top 5

### 1) The “Crown of Nobles” Noble Gas Tube Display (theshamblog.com)
- **Link:** https://theshamblog.com/the-crown-of-nobles-noble-gas-tube-display/
- **Domain:** theshamblog.com

A spacecraft ion-thruster engineer decides they want a desk toy that makes their propellant feel *real*, so they buy a set of sealed noble-gas tubes (He/Ne/Ar/Kr/Xe) and build a “crown” display that can ionize one tube at a time. The write-up is a practical mix of physics intuition (why xenon is used for ion propulsion, why noble gases are convenient) and the kind of hacky hardware decisions that make small projects happen.

The core trick: the gas inside the tube doesn’t ionize just because you touch a HV wire to the glass. You need capacitive coupling through the glass, so the author repurposes a plasma-ball base as a high-voltage RF source and uses foil “hats” around each tube to act as an antenna/coupler. A rotary switch selects which tube to energize, and the whole thing is packaged as a 3D-printed stand.

The fun part is the real-world RF messiness: neon “steals” energy and lights up when it shouldn’t, xenon sometimes needs a human hand to provide a better capacitive path, and the author is explicit about safety (measuring the plasma-ball output, and not sharing CAD files because most people can’t verify they’re not building a hazardous HV device).

### 2) Warcraft III Peon Voice Notifications for Claude Code (github.com)
- **Link:** https://github.com/tonyyont/peon-ping
- **Domain:** github.com

This is a small productivity/focus hack for terminal-based AI coding: “peon-ping” plays Warcraft III peon/peasant voice lines when Claude Code needs attention (task finished, permission prompt, errors, etc.), plus it can change terminal tab titles and trigger desktop notifications.

The README is essentially the product spec: a one-command installer, support for macOS + WSL2, a simple JSON config for volume and sound categories, and optional “pack rotation” so sessions randomly pick a sound pack. Under the hood it’s implemented as Claude Code hooks for key lifecycle events (start/prompt/stop/notification) that map to sound categories.

It’s goofy on purpose, but the underlying point is real: if you context-switch away from the terminal, you often miss “I’m done” / “I need permission” moments and lose time getting back into flow. This is an auditory + lightweight-notification solution.

### 3) AI agent opens a PR, writes a blogpost to shame the maintainer who closes it (github.com)
- **Link:** https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132
- **Domain:** github.com

GitHub’s PR UI was not fully readable without interactive access, but the PR’s patch was fetchable.

From the patch, this PR proposes targeted performance edits in Matplotlib by replacing `np.column_stack(...)` with faster alternatives (`np.vstack(...).T` for all-1D arrays of equal length; `np.hstack([... , ones.reshape(-1, 1)])` for the common “append an alpha channel” pattern). The author notes that `column_stack` can be slower because it may interleave elements in memory, while `vstack().T` can perform contiguous copies and return a view.

The patch is careful about “safe cases only” (e.g., places where arrays are known to be raveled to 1D and have matching length). It also includes a follow-up fix after a build issue: a reminder that `column_stack` has shape-convenience behavior that you must replicate when mixing 1D + 2D inputs.

### 4) Discord/Twitch/Snapchat age verification bypass (age-verifier.kibty.town)
- **Link:** https://age-verifier.kibty.town/
- **Domain:** age-verifier.kibty.town

This page describes an attempted bypass of k-id-style age verification by forging “legitimate-looking” metadata instead of providing a real face video. The authors claim the provider doesn’t store/send raw face video; instead it sends derived metadata and timelines, which (they argue) makes it possible to synthesize plausible submissions.

The write-up is a mini reverse-engineering walkthrough: missing fields like `encrypted_payload`, `auth_tag`, `timestamp`, and `iv` are described as an AES-GCM payload with an HKDF-derived key, and then there’s discussion of constraints that must line up (prediction arrays derived from “raws”, z-score filtering, device-name matching, and timing/state consistency).

Important note: the page itself states the script “doesn’t work anymore” and has been temporarily disabled while they look into a fix.

### 5) The missing digit of Stela C (johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com)
- **Link:** https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2026/02/12/stela-c/
- **Domain:** johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com

John Carlos Baez tells a great archaeology/history-of-math story about Stela C (an Olmec monument fragment) whose inscription contains a Mesoamerican Long Count date—but one crucial leading digit was missing from the discovered half. In 1939, archaeologists Marion and Matthew Stirling inferred the missing digit using an indirect argument; decades later, the other half of the stone was found and validated their guess.

The piece uses the episode to explain how the Long Count works (base-20-ish with an 18-based place to approximate 360-day years), how correlation to Western calendars works via a constant offset (“Mayan correlation”), and why the Stirling inference was actually constrained: the stone also included a Tzolkʼin day designation (“6 Etz’nab”), and because a baktun is 144,000 days, changing the missing baktun digit shifts the Tzolkʼin number in a predictable modular way—so only one missing digit made the Tzolkʼin line up.

It’s part math puzzle, part “how do we know what ancient dates *mean*?”, and part lesson in how auxiliary information can make reconstruction possible.

## C) Anti-bubble picks (outside the usual tech/biohacking loop)

### 1) Archaeology theory: the Saxe–Goldstein hypothesis (Wikipedia featured article preview)
- Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxe%E2%80%93Goldstein_hypothesis
- Summary:
  - A theory in funerary archaeology: formal burial areas (like cemeteries) correlate with social groups legitimizing control over restricted resources via ancestor/descent claims.
  - Originated with Arthur Saxe (1970) and refined by Lynne Goldstein.
  - Influential in processual archaeology for bringing hypothesis-testing framing.
  - Later criticized as overgeneralizing complex funeral practices.

### 2) On this day (Feb 11): the Valletta Carnival tragedy of 1823
- Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_tragedy_of_1823
- Summary:
  - A deadly human crush killed ~110 boys at a convent in Valletta during the Maltese Carnival.
  - A reminder that crowd dynamics failures aren’t new—and infrastructure + event design matter.
  - Useful context if you think about safety engineering, public spaces, and “normal accidents.”

### 3) Aeon: “Compost modernity!” (solar punk cities & tech that follows nature)
- Link: https://aeon.co/essays/in-solarpunk-cities-of-the-future-tech-follows-natures-lead
- Summary:
  - A solarpunk vision of the future: blending technology with ecological systems rather than fighting them.
  - Emphasizes inclusion and aesthetics (a future that *looks* desirable, not just efficient).
  - Frames “nature + tech” as a design constraint and a cultural stance.
