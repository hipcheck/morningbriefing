### Toyota Fluorite: "console-grade" Flutter game engine
- **Domain:** fluorite.game
- **Link:** https://fluorite.game/

Fluorite Game Engine Game Engine Fluorite is the first console-grade game engine fully integrated with Flutter. Its reduced complexity by allowing you to write your game code directly in Dart, and using all of its great developer tools.

By using a FluoriteView widget you can add multiple simultaneous views of your 3D scene, as well as share state between game Entities and UI widgets - the Flutter way! High-performance ECS core At the heart of Fluorite lies a data-oriented ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture.

It's written in C++ to allow for maximum performance and targeted optimizations, yielding great performance on lower-end/embedded hardware. At the same time, it allows you to write game code using familiar high-level game APIs in Dart, making most of your game development knowledge transferrable from other engines.

Your browser does not support the video tag. Model-defined touch trigger zones This feature enables 3D Artists to define “clickable” zones directly in Blender, and to configure them to trigger specific events!

GLM-5: From Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering Simon Willison’s Weblog Subscribe GLM-5: From Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering ( via ) This is a huge new MIT-licensed model: 754B parameters and 1.51TB on Hugging Face twice the size of GLM-4.7 which was 368B and 717GB (4.5 and 4.6 were around that size too). It's interesting to see Z.ai take a position on what we should call professional software engineers building with LLMs - I've seen "Agentic Engineering" show up in a few other places recently. most notable from Andrej Karpathy and Addy Osmani .

### NetNewsWire Turns 23

NetNewsWire - NetNewsWire Turns 23 NetNewsWire Blog Feb 11, 2026 NetNewsWire Turns 23 NetNewsWire 1.0 for Mac shipped 23 years ago today! 🎸🎩🕶️ Here’s where things are on this particular February 11: we just shipped 7.0 for Mac and iOS, and now we’re working on NetNewsWire 7.0.1. After a big release, no matter how careful we are, there are often some regressions to fix and tweaks to make right away, so we’re working on those. Here’s the milestone with the current to-do list .

Big picture: we still have a lot of bugs to fix, lots of tech debt to deal with, and lots of polish-needed areas of the app. With Brent’s retirement last year we’ve been able to go way faster on dealing with all this. We plan to keep up the pace.

Here are our current plans: For NetNewsWire 7.1 we’re focusing on syncing fixes and improvements. NetNewsWire 7.2 doesn’t have a focus yet. Could end up being UX fixes and polish, could be something else.

Could be a potpourri, though we do prefer having a focus when possible.
### Claude Code Is Being Dumbed Down

Claude Code Is Being Dumbed Down | Symmetry Breaking SB Symmetry Breaking Claude Code Is Being Dumbed Down February 11, 2026 by Yoshi Version 2.1.20 of Claude Code shipped a change that replaced every file read and every search pattern with a single, useless summary line. Where you used to see: You now get: That’s it. “Read 3 files.” Which files? Doesn’t matter. “Searched for 1 pattern.” What pattern?

Who cares. You’re paying $200 a month for a tool that now hides what it’s doing with your codebase by default. Across multiple GitHub issues opened for this, all comments are pretty much saying the same thing: give us back the file paths, or at minimum, give us a toggle.

The response from Anthropic: For the majority of users, this change is a nice simplification that reduces noise. What majority? The change just shipped and the only response it got is people complaining.

Then when pressed, the fix offered wasn’t to revert or add a toggle.
### Microwave Oven Failure: Spontaneously turned on by its LED display (2024)
- **Domain:** blog.stuffedcow.net

Microwave Oven Failure: Spontaneously turned on… by its LED display « Blog Blog Random stuff… Comments Posts Home Blog About Uncategorized Measuring Stuff Fixing Stuff Building Stuff Taking apart stuff « Shell Scripting in C++ Calculator » Microwave Oven Failure: Spontaneously turned on… by its LED display By Henry, on June 29th, 2024 My microwave oven started to malfunction at around five years old. It started to randomly power on the lamp, fan, and turntable.

It progressively got worse over several weeks until it was mostly stuck on. The microwave oven is not usable when this happens: It behaves as if the door were open, causing the control panel to ignore button input and to stop cooking if it was cooking.

The obvious suspect is a failing door switch, which is a common cause of failure. There are three switches in the door, and a failure of one or more of them can cause strange behaviour when not all three switches agree on whether the door is open or closed.

**My list of fasting benefits - Updated and ranked by strength of evidence**
- Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1r25y4n/my_list_of_fasting_benefits_updated_and_ranked_by/
- Summary:
  - Hey folks! Recently I saw a post about extended fasting. As a big proponent of fasting, I’d like to add a couple of points. First, fasting requires effort, it's not a casual thing. Even a short-term fast of 2-3 days takes a solid effort to make it happen. Though with practice, it becomes quite doable. It’s like running 10 miles. For some people, it’s an unachievable goal, but for others it’s a weekly routine. So it’s really a matter of practice.
  - But fasting offers a ton of benefits, and I wanted to share my list of fasting benefits. If you saw a previous version of this list, this is an updated one. Basically, I added several benefits I previously missed, removed others where the evidence didn’t hold up, and included more recent papers to back it all up.
  - And now this list is ranked all benefits using a weighted evidence system based on mechanistic plausibility, human observational data, human RCTs, directness to the claim and more. So, some benefits moved quite a bit - for example, “Stimulates Autophagy” is now in the Early-Stage Research section: strong mechanistic plausibility, but weak human evidence.
  - As for the color dots next to each fasting benefit
  - - Green - intermittent fasting
  - - Yellow - short-term fasting (up to 72 hours)

**Bryan's Updated 2026 Protocol**
- Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1qm3dk0/bryans_updated_2026_protocol/
- Summary:
  - “Hi friends,
  - We might be the first generation that doesn't die. To that end, my team and I have spent the last few years building the world's first Don't Die protocol.
  - Some of you don't care about Don't Die, you just want to be hot. That's cool too. It's really the same thing.
  - To make this Don't Die thing understandable, I've made it into a game because humans love games. You'll learn how to flex your biomarkers with friends. You'll be able to share the science with friends on why poor sleep is a terrible idea.
  - Personally, I have kind of taken this whole thing to the extreme. There's the world's fastest person, and the richest, but never before has there been the "Healthiest Person in the World."
  - I've tried to become that person. I am certainly the most biologically measured person ever.

**Blueprint just raised $60M to bring Bryan's longevity protocol to everyone**
- Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1oim0kr/blueprint_just_raised_60m_to_bring_bryans/
- Summary:
  - Hey All!
  - Big news dropped today that I wanted to share with you all: Blueprint just closed a $60 million funding round.
  - TLDR: Bryan Johnson's longevity protocol is about to become accessible to the general public through a comprehensive platform. This could be a pretty significant moment for the biohacking/longevity space.
  - They're building out a full-service platform that includes:
  - Blood testing and biomarker tracking Personalized health protocols Food delivery, GLP-1 access, prescription services At-home testing, toxin screening Skin/hair care products Supplements and nutrition Advanced longevity therapies An AI health companion to tie it all together Basically trying to make Bryan's entire protocol - measurements, therapies, protocols - replicable for everyone at different budget and commitment levels with more personalization.

**Does longevity mix have noticeable effects?**
- Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1r20qsh/does_longevity_mix_have_noticeable_effects/
- Summary:
  - I’m just about to finish my second bag of it and honestly I have no idea if it’s working. I’ve taken it every day until about 2 weeks ago and then took like 4 days off and felt no noticeable difference though I wasn’t paying close attention. Or, is it solely supposed to help in the “long” term? thank you!

**Week 3 is where I always quit. So I started keeping receipts. Here's what changed**
- Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r1w24m/week_3_is_where_i_always_quit_so_i_started/
- Summary:
  - I've tried everything to stay consistent with self-improvement. Habit trackers, accountability partners, motivational quotes on my wall even. Nothing lasted more than 3 weeks. I honestly started feeling incapable / not meant for it.
  - The problem wasn't discipline. It was that I kept forgetting I was actually making progress.
  - Here's what I mean:
  - I start strong. First week, I hit the gym 4 times, meal prep Sunday, wake up at 6 AM. I feel unstoppable.
  - Week 3, I miss a workout. Then two. I sleep in one day. Suddenly I feel like I'm "falling off" and the voice in my head says "see, you always do this." FUCK.
  - But here's the thing: I'm not actually back at zero. I just forgot about the 15 workouts I crushed, the 12 early mornings, the week I stuck to my meal plan perfectly.

**[CHALLENGE] WEEK 3 JANUARY JUMPSTART CHECK-IN: Still Showing Up?**
- Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1qh9sym/challenge_week_3_january_jumpstart_checkin_still/
- Summary:
  - Three weeks in. This is where habits stop feeling shiny and start feeling real.
  - By now, your plan isn’t exciting; it’s inconvenient. This is the point where most people loosen standards, start negotiating with themselves, or quietly stop checking in.
  - So let’s be honest.
  - Did you do what you said you would? If not, did you adjust — or just drift? What held up under pressure? What broke when life got busy? No excuses needed. Just accountability.
  - Maybe your data surprised you. Maybe you missed a few days and got back on track anyway. That still counts.
  - Drop your Week 3 update below and share what helped you stay consistent this week. Use this space to trade ideas, normalize the messy parts, and encourage someone else who’s showing up alongside you.
