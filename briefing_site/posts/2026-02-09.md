### Thoughts on Generating C (wingolog.org)

- Link: https://wingolog.org/archives/2026/02/09/six-thoughts-on-generating-c
- HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46945235

Top comment excerpt:
- rirze: Love how he put a paragraph for someone asking, "why not generate Rust?".

Summary:
The author (a compiler engineer) shares practical patterns for compilers that emit C as a target language. Main theme: keep semantics explicit and let the C compiler erase abstraction costs (e.g., `static inline` + `always_inline` helpers).

Key tips: avoid implicit integer conversions (`-Wconversion`), wrap raw pointers/integers in single-field structs, and use `memcpy` for unaligned loads/stores. For tail calls / weird ABIs, do some manual register allocation instead of relying on the C compiler.

### UEFI Bindings for JavaScript (codeberg.org)

- HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46943568

Summary:
Two builders report an exhaustive, planet-scale computation of the longest line of sight on Earth, confirming a roughly 530 km view (Hindu Kush ↔ Pik Dankova). Includes an interactive map with billions of LOS lines.

### Browse Internet Infrastructure (wirewiki.com)
