## A) Hacker News — Top 5

### 1) Zig – io_uring and Grand Central Dispatch `std.Io` implementations landed
- Domain: ziglang.org
- Link: https://ziglang.org/devlog/2026/#2026-02-13

Zig’s standard library I/O story is moving toward “swap the engine, keep the app code the same.” The devlog entry announces new experimental `std.Io.Evented` backends for Linux (`io_uring`) and macOS (Grand Central Dispatch), both built on userspace stack switching (fibers / stackful coroutines).

The practical upshot is an architecture where your application can be written against `std.Io` and then run with a threaded or evented implementation by changing only initialization. The post is explicit that it’s not “done” yet—error handling, tests, and a performance regression in the compiler path remain open—but the direction is clear: standard-library-level I/O pluggability, with cancellation and platform-native async primitives.

### 2) Show HN: I spent 3 years reverse-engineering a 40 yo stock market sim from 1986
- Domain: wallstreetraider.com
- Link: https://www.wallstreetraider.com/story.html

A long, very human project write-up about resurrecting *Wall Street Raider*, a famously deep finance simulator originally written in BASIC for DOS. The author frames it as “a dragon that couldn’t be slain”: multiple prior attempts by teams with budgets failed to modernize or port it, largely because the simulation logic is tightly bound to domain knowledge (corporate finance, tax law, market mechanics) and decades of accreted code.

The story doubles as a portrait of “legacy software as living artifact.” It highlights how the original creator iterated over decades, patching exploits like a regulator, and how the game inadvertently became a training ground for real-world finance careers. The reverse-engineering effort is positioned less as a rewrite and more as translating an ecosystem of assumptions into something maintainable and shippable today.

### 3) Show HN: SQL-tap – Real-time SQL traffic viewer for PostgreSQL and MySQL
- Domain: github.com
- Link: https://github.com/mickamy/sql-tap

`sql-tap` is a transparent proxy plus terminal UI that lets you watch SQL traffic in real time by parsing the native Postgres/MySQL wire protocols. The key pitch: no application code changes—just point the app to the proxy port—then inspect queries, transactions, timings, errors, and parameter bindings as they flow.

A standout feature is the ability to run `EXPLAIN` / `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on captured queries (assuming you provide a DSN via env var), and even edit a captured query before explaining it. It’s essentially “tcpdump meets a query profiler,” with interactive navigation and an analytics view for aggregations.

### 4) The Three Year Myth
- Domain: green.spacedino.net
- Link: https://green.spacedino.net/the-three-year-myth/

An essay arguing that “wait 2–3 years and it will happen” is often a career trap: a way for organizations to defer promotions or process change until the moment your contributions can be sidelined or re-attributed. The author writes from fresh layoff experience and frames the pattern as repeated across org sizes and industries.

The core claim is that timing isn’t the main constraint—stakeholders are. If leadership truly wants a promotion, a raise, or a change, it can happen quickly; “just wait” often protects current power structures. The essay’s advice is blunt: treat long, vague delays (without concrete reasons and milestones) as a signal to seek other options.

### 5) Understanding the Go Compiler: The Linker
- Domain: internals-for-interns.com
- Link: https://internals-for-interns.com/posts/the-go-linker/

A guided tour of what the Go linker does after packages compile into separate object files: symbol resolution across packages, relocation (patching placeholder addresses), dead code elimination (reachability marking), and final executable layout (sections/segments + OS-specific formats like ELF/Mach-O/PE).

The post is especially useful for demystifying why Go’s statically-linked binaries aren’t *as* huge as you might expect: whole-program reachability pruning discards unused functions/data across imported packages. It also shows how the runtime entrypoint differs from your `main.main`, and why segment layout matters for W^X and platform loaders.

## B) Reddit — Top topics (summarized)

Notes: Reddit JSON/HTML can be blocked; summaries below rely on each subreddit’s RSS/Atom feed content. If a post is primarily an image/link with little text in RSS, the summary may be unavailable.

### r/Biohackers (top 3)

1) **Notice on Epstein Related Posts** — https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1qtwb40/notice_on_epstein_related_posts/
- Summary:
  - Mods are temporarily pausing *new* posts about certain health influencers appearing in Epstein-file discussions.
  - Rationale: many posts are repeating the same claims; existing threads remain open for discussion.
  - They’re explicitly asking the community for feedback on whether the pause is appropriate.
- Why it matters:
  - Signals active moderation to reduce repetitive, low-signal cycles during fast-moving news.
  - Helps keep the subreddit’s front page usable for non-breaking-news biohacking topics.

2) **Flintstones vitamins for the win.** — https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1r45nq6/flintstones_vitamins_for_the_win/
- Summary: **Summary unavailable (insufficient content in RSS)** (image/link post).
- Why it matters:
  - A reminder that “compliance beats optimization” is still a common theme—simple routines often win.

3) **Prasad turned FDA into political theater** — https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1r4gyt0/prasad_turned_fda_into_political_theater/
- Summary:
  - The post quotes a Wall Street Journal editorial criticizing FDA vaccine-division leadership decisions.
  - It frames the decision as damaging to innovation and procedurally questionable.
  - Discussion prompt is implicit: how much of regulatory action is science vs politics.
- Why it matters:
  - Regulatory posture can swing timelines for new vaccine platforms (and investor/industry behavior).
  - Helps calibrate “science news” vs “policy narrative” when biohacking communities interpret headlines.

### r/blueprint_ (top 3)

1) **Bryan’s Updated 2026 Protocol** — https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1qm3dk0/bryans_updated_2026_protocol/
- Summary:
  - Reposts a Bryan Johnson note about turning the “Don’t Die” protocol into a clearer, more social, game-like system.
  - Emphasizes measurement density and behavior change framing (health as top priority).
  - Links to the full protocol page for details.
- Why it matters:
  - If you track “Blueprint” as a movement, this is an attempt at packaging adherence and community dynamics, not just a stack.

2) **Super shroom grit** — https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1r3ye34/super_shroom_grit/
- Summary:
  - User reports undissolved “grounds”/slurry at the bottom when mixing a mushroom coffee supplement.
  - Tried different preparation (including Aeropress) but residue remains.
  - Asks whether the leftover material indicates poor absorption or a product issue.
- Why it matters:
  - Practical “last-mile” adherence issue: if it’s unpleasant, people stop; if it’s insoluble, dosing may be inconsistent.

3) **Do the supplements work for you?** — https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1r3xgo6/do_the_suppliments_work_for_you/
- Summary:
  - User asks for first-hand reports: which Blueprint supplements feel meaningful and what changes people noticed.
  - Implicitly questions ROI across the stack (cost vs subjective effect).
  - Opens the door to N=1 anecdotes vs biomarker-backed claims.
- Why it matters:
  - Separating “feels different” from “measurably different” is a recurring failure mode in supplement discussions.

### r/productivity (top 3)

1) **Why do you stop using habit tracking apps?** — https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r4eye7/why_do_you_stop_using_habit_tracking_apps/
- Summary:
  - User reports a common pattern: strong start for 2–3 weeks, then drop-off.
  - Asks what annoys people about habit apps and what an ideal tracker would do differently.
  - Implicitly invites discussion on motivation vs friction vs “app guilt.”
- Why it matters:
  - Useful lens for designing routines: the failure point is often *maintenance*, not onboarding.

2) **About to be commuting 2 hours/day; how can I put the time to good use?** — https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r4a164/about_to_be_commuting_2_hoursday_how_can_i_put/
- Summary:
  - User wants long-form, mostly-free learning resources that fit a 1-hour commute block.
  - Interests include negotiation/soft skills, language learning, investing, writing/worldbuilding.
  - Wants tools for voice notes + better transcription that handles accent and punctuation commands.
- Why it matters:
  - Commute time is one of the few “captive blocks” many people can reliably repurpose without calendar fights.

3) **What’s a simple photo/video workflow for a non-techy coach?** — https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r4fxyi/whats_a_simple_photovideo_workflow_for_a_nontechy/
- Summary:
  - Coach films clients’ form, then manually uploads/sorts/shares—now scaling pain.
  - Wants a phone-first workflow: capture → drop → client sees only their content.
  - Asks for simple tools that reduce daily admin overhead.
- Why it matters:
  - A classic “ops bottleneck”: growth turns an okay manual workflow into a time sink.

### r/whoop (top 3)

1) **HRV-CV and recovery Consistency: What the Research Says** — https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1r30lhm/hrvcv_and_recovery_consistency_what_the_research/
- Summary:
  - Introduces HRV-CV (coefficient of variation) as a *stability* lens: not just today’s HRV, but how much HRV swings night-to-night.
  - Claims higher alcohol intake, inconsistent sleep, and irregular training associate with higher HRV-CV; consistent routines associate with lower HRV-CV.
  - Notes HRV-CV isn’t surfaced as a standalone metric yet, but can be queried via WHOOP AI.
- Why it matters:
  - Helps prevent “single-number chasing” by emphasizing variability as a behavior signal.

2) **I drank alcohol first time in 3 months.** — https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1r4hg86/i_drank_alcohol_first_time_in_3_months/
- Summary: **Summary unavailable (insufficient content in RSS)** (image/link post).
- Why it matters:
  - These posts often become informal experiments on recovery deltas after alcohol.

3) **Terrible recovery from eating out ALWAYS** — https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1r4hmc6/terrible_recovery_from_eating_out_always/
- Summary:
  - User reports consistently worse sleep/recovery metrics after late, heavy restaurant meals.
  - Notes fasting/early cut-off works well; “eating out” disrupts sleep and tanks recovery.
  - Asks if others observe the same pattern.
- Why it matters:
  - A simple lever: meal timing/size can be a bigger recovery driver than “supplement tinkering.”

### r/slatestarcodex (top 3)

1) **Monthly Discussion Thread** — https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/1qtftuw/monthly_discussion_thread/
- Summary:
  - Open-thread style post: small links/questions/discussion topics in one place.
  - Explicit reminder to avoid culture-war-adjacent topics.
  - Functions as the community’s “ambient discourse” hub.
- Why it matters:
  - Good for sampling what the community is thinking about without chasing individual posts.

2) **AMA (Ask Machines Anything)** — https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/1r3p6ey/ama_ask_machines_anything/
- Summary: **Summary unavailable (insufficient content in RSS)** (external link post).
- Why it matters:
  - Likely to generate high-quality Q&A patterns for prompts, epistemics, and “how people question systems.”

3) **An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me - More Things Have Happened** — https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/1r46sb6/an_ai_agent_published_a_hit_piece_on_me_more/
- Summary: **Summary unavailable (insufficient content in RSS)** (external link post).
- Why it matters:
  - Part of the ongoing “agents + reputation + attribution” conversation: what happens when automated content targets individuals.

## C) Anti-bubble picks (outside the usual sources)

### 1) Institutions are a technology for scaling trust (Aeon)
- Link: https://aeon.co/essays/institutions-are-how-we-scale-up-cooperation-among-millions?utm_source=rss-feed
- Summary:
  - Argues that well-designed institutions function as “social technology” that lets cooperation scale beyond personal trust.
  - Focuses on how rules, enforcement, and legitimacy interact—why institutions can both enable coordination and fail in predictable ways.
  - A useful prompt to think about *governance as engineering*: what constraints produce stable cooperation.

### 2) The Saxe–Goldstein hypothesis (Wikipedia: today’s featured article preview)
- Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxe%E2%80%93Goldstein_hypothesis
- Summary:
  - Archaeological hypothesis linking formal burial areas (cemeteries) with social groups legitimizing control of restricted resources via ancestry.
  - Historically influential in funerary archaeology, especially among processual archaeologists aiming for more “scientific” generalizations.
  - Later criticized as oversimplifying the complex drivers of funerary practice.

### 3) Today in history: February 14 (Wikipedia)
- Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_14
- Summary:
  - A quick scan of notable events includes the Oaths of Strasbourg (842), Oregon statehood (1859), IBM’s renaming (1924), and more.
  - Useful as a lightweight “pattern interrupt”: a non-tech timeline that can spark curiosity (or a rabbit hole) beyond the usual feeds.
