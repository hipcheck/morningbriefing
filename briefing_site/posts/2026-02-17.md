## A) Hacker News — Top 5

### 1) GrapheneOS – Break Free from Google and Apple
Domain: blog.tomaszdunia.pl

HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47045612


A first-person, practical write-up on switching away from the Apple ecosystem and going "de-Googled" via GrapheneOS (a hardened Android variant). It walks through device choice (Pixel-only reality), bootloader unlock/flash/relock flow, and a realistic "day 2" setup: separate user profiles, permission discipline, and app sourcing (e.g., Aurora Store / Obtainium) to reduce Google dependence without completely breaking modern life.

### 2) Is Show HN Dead? No, but It's Drowning

HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47045804


A data-driven look at how Show HN has changed under the new reality of vastly increased project volume (and "vibecoded" churn). The argument: Show HN isn't dead, but attention per post is collapsing, posts get pushed off page 1 faster, and discussion per submission is down — meaning interesting projects are increasingly likely to disappear without feedback.

### 3) Four Column ASCII (2017)

HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13539552


A delightful explanation of why so many terminal control key combos map to the characters they do (e.g., why Ctrl+[ is ESC). The core trick is viewing ASCII in 4 columns of 32: Ctrl effectively clears the high bits, turning printable characters into their corresponding control codes and making the bit-level structure of ASCII feel obvious.

### 4) 14-year-old wins prize for origami that can hold 10,000× its own weight
Domain: sciencealert.com
Link: https://www.sciencealert.com/14-year-old-wins-prize-for-origami-that-can-hold-10000-times-its-own-weight

A profile of a middle-school research project that’s more engineering than “science fair”: systematic stress-testing of Miura-ori fold variations (paper types + parallelogram geometry) to optimize strength-to-weight. The motivating application is deployable emergency shelters — aiming for structures that are compact, fast to deploy, and surprisingly strong.

### 5) Rise of the Triforce

Link: https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2026/02/16/rise-of-the-triforce/
HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47040524


A deep dive into the Triforce arcade platform (a Sega + Nintendo + Namco collaboration built around GameCube hardware), with historical context on the arcade industry’s post-5th-gen shift toward console-derived boards. It also highlights emulator work: how Triforce boot flow, boards, I/O, and media differ from retail GameCube/Wii, and what it takes for Dolphin to emulate that ecosystem accurately.

## B) Reddit — Top topics (summarized)

> Note: Reddit HTML/JSON can be blocked; these summaries are derived from each subreddit's RSS feed content. If the RSS entry didn’t include enough substance, the summary is marked unavailable.

### r/Biohackers

1) **Notice on Epstein Related Posts** — https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1qtwb40/notice_on_epstein_related_posts/
- **Summary (from RSS):** Mods are temporarily pausing new posts about certain health influencers being in Epstein-related files pending significant updates, to reduce repetitive churn.
- **Why it matters:** A moderation pattern you’ll likely see more of: “topic quarantine” to keep n=1 health experimentation communities from getting swallowed by outrage cycles.

2) **January Community Update (PLEASE READ)** — https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1qffedh/january_community_update_please_read/
- **Summary (from RSS):** Growth update + community initiatives (AMAs, possible weekly roundups), plus a call for better misinformation moderation.
- **Why it matters:** When communities cross a size threshold, the constraint shifts from "ideas" to governance (signal/noise, incentives, moderation tooling).

3) **What was the Closest Thing You Found to "the Vitamin"** — https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1r5e9t9/what_was_the_closest_thing_you_found_to_the_vitamin/
- **Summary:** Summary unavailable (insufficient content in RSS).
- **Why it matters:** These threads often surface "one change that moved the needle" anecdotes worth cross-checking against actual biomarkers and safety.

### r/blueprint_

1) **Bryan's Updated 2026 Protocol** — https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1qm3dk0/bryans_updated_2026_protocol/
- **Summary (from RSS):** Reposts/quotes the framing of Blueprint as a measurable "Don't Die" protocol, with a link to the updated protocol site.
- **Why it matters:** Useful for spotting protocol deltas (tests/routines/supplements) and for noticing how gamified health products shape adherence.

2) **Blueprint just raised $60M to bring Bryan's longevity protocol to everyone** — https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1oim0kr/blueprint_just_raised_60m_to_bring_bryans/
- **Summary (from RSS):** Claims a $60M raise to productize the protocol (testing/tracking/services/"AI companion"), with investor/leadership notes.
- **Why it matters:** Platformization increases access, but raises stakes around validation, incentives, and especially data portability.

3) **Does anyone know the type of ice packs Bryan uses on his sack in the sauna?** — https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1r5eun4/does_anyone_know_the_type_of_ice_packs_bryan_uses/
- **Summary (from RSS):** Practical question about specific cold packs used during sauna routines.
- **Why it matters:** A reminder that "protocol" quickly becomes logistics; small gear choices can become adherence bottlenecks.

### r/productivity

1) **/r/productivity is being hit hard by AI generated slop + advertising spam. Please hit REPORT on this content!** — https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r4r2bm/rproductivity_is_being_hit_hard_by_ai_generated/
- **Summary (from RSS):** Mod request to actively report AI-generated and advertising content.
- **Why it matters:** If moderation fails, tactic-sharing communities collapse into engagement farming; community-wide reporting is one of the few scalable defenses.

2) **Things to do in the morning other than brain rot** — https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r5e6h0/things_to_do_in_the_morning_other_than_brain_rot/
- **Summary (from RSS):** Prompt for low-stimulation morning routines (when you’re trying not to immediately reach for your phone).
- **Why it matters:** Morning inputs set attentional tone; this is a good thread to mine for “default replacements” (walk, journaling, planning ritual).

3) **I simplified my productivity system to the point where I can’t procrastinate anymore** — https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r5ds8c/i_simplified_my_productivity_system_to_the_point/
- **Summary (from RSS):** A "remove almost everything" system: one main task/day + a short list, to prevent meta-work.
- **Why it matters:** A useful counterweight to tooling obsession; simplification is often the highest-ROI productivity intervention.

### r/whoop

1) **Whoop X Chase Sapphire Reserve Redemption Steps** — https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1r5e3z5/whoop_x_chase_sapphire_reserve_redemption_steps/
- **Summary (from RSS):** A step-by-step guide to claiming the Chase Sapphire Reserve Whoop statement credit.
- **Why it matters:** Good operational info if you’re optimizing device costs; also a reminder to treat perks like a checklist, not a mystery.

2) **HRV-CV and recovery Consistency: What the Research Says** — https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1r30lhm/hrvcv_and_recovery_consistency_what_the_research/
- **Summary (from RSS):** Introduces HRV-CV (coefficient of variation) as a stability metric and relates higher variability to behaviors like alcohol/inconsistent sleep.
- **Why it matters:** Mean HRV can look “fine” while volatility signals instability; CV can be a better training-planning input than single-night recovery.

3) **Only thing I regret wearing is my whoop** — https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1r5d4dz/only_thing_i_regret_wearing_is_my_whoop/
- **Summary (from RSS):** Light/relatable regret about wearing Whoop during wedding-dress shopping.
- **Why it matters:** Wearables create "context friction"; if comfort/aesthetics aren’t solved, adherence breaks in real-life moments.

### r/slatestarcodex

1) **Monthly Discussion Thread** — https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/1qtftuw/monthly_discussion_thread/
- **Summary:** Summary unavailable (insufficient content in RSS).
- **Why it matters:** Open threads are often where link curation and “small but sharp” questions show up.

2) **AMA (Ask Machines Anything)** — https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/1r3p6ey/ama_ask_machines_anything/
- **Summary:** Summary unavailable (insufficient content in RSS).
- **Why it matters:** Meta-signal for what rationalist-adjacent readers are currently asking AIs (and worrying about).

3) **the lottery of career success: or why you may want to bribe OpenAI** — https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/1r5c5w4/the_lottery_of_career_success_or_why_you_may_want/
- **Summary (from RSS):** A provocative post about career success as a high-variance lottery and the weirdness of paying for status-signaling “slots.”
- **Why it matters:** Even if you disagree, it’s a useful prompt to examine what you’re actually optimizing (learning, income, prestige, autonomy).

## C) Anti-bubble picks (outside Andreas’s usual sources)

### 1) The Public Domain Review — Cybernetic Attention: All Watched over by Machines We Learned to Watch
Link: https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/cybernetic-attention/

A pre-history of the “attention economy” told through mid-20th-century pursuit tests designed to measure focus under pressure (often for aviation/military contexts). It’s a nice corrective to the modern assumption that attention measurement is a smartphone-era invention: the slicing/dicing of human focus has a long lineage in lab instrumentation.

### 2) The Public Domain Review — Roma Lister, Aradia, and the Speculative Origins of a Witchcraft Revival
Link: https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/roma-lister-aradia/

A cultural-history rabbit hole: Aradia (1899) as a catalyst text for modern witchcraft/pagan revivals, and the conjecture that a particular writer/medium (Roma Lister) may have been more central to the book’s formation than commonly acknowledged. Good for getting out of a “tech-only” reading groove into the messy ecology of texts, myths, and movements.

### 3) Biological Reviews (via PubMed Central) — Historical ecology: past, present and future
Link: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5424069/

A broad review of “historical ecology” as an umbrella for studying human–nature interactions across time, spanning ecology, geography, anthropology, and history. The payoff: it helps you see why ecological baselines are often illusions (landscapes have long, layered human histories) and why interdisciplinary methods are necessary if you care about real-world conservation and restoration.
