## B) Reddit — Top topics (summarized)

Pulled from r/popular; themes below (with representative threads):

- **Work/tech & surveillance:** discussion about workplaces using tech to audit/measure employee productivity.
- **Culture + politics:** a prompt about “the most attractive politician in your country” and how people read public image/charisma.
- **Entertainment & emotion:** a big AskReddit thread on movies people won’t rewatch because they were too heartbreaking.
- **Personal safety / awareness:** a Lithuanian public-safety guide about identifying a kidnapped victim sparked broad discussion.
- **Home theater / media settings:** debate about the “soap opera effect” (motion smoothing) and why many TVs ship with it enabled.
