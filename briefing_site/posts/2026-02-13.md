## A) Hacker News — Top 5

### 1) MinIO repository is no longer maintained (github.com)
Link: https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/7aac2a2c5b7c882e68c1ce017d8256be2feea27f
HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47000041


MinIO (the open-source object storage server) has updated its repository messaging to state explicitly that **this repository is no longer maintained**. The commit updates the README to a prominent “NOTE” callout and points readers toward MinIO’s AIStor offerings instead.

Practically, this is a “heads up” for anyone depending on upstream changes, security fixes, or ongoing community maintenance: you should assume **no new commits will land here** and plan accordingly (fork, migrate, or switch to an alternative). The README also reiterates AGPLv3 obligations and clarifies that community support is best-effort.

### 2) Resizing windows on macOS Tahoe – the saga continues (noheger.at)
Link: https://noheger.at/blog/2026/02/12/resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe-the-saga-continues/
HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46997008


Apple briefly claimed a fix for a long-running macOS window-resize “hit area” issue in the macOS 26.3 release candidate, and the author set out to test what changed. They built a small app that scans pixel-by-pixel around the window’s bottom-right corner, repeatedly simulating clicks to map where resize events are actually detected.

The RC improved things by making the resize regions follow the rounded-corner radius rather than remaining square. But it also made the “vertical-only/horizontal-only” resize band thinner (a small but noticeable usability regression). In the final release, the author reports the fix was **removed entirely** and the release notes were updated from “Resolved” back to “Known Issue.”

### 3) MMAcevedo aka Lena (by qntm) (qntm.org)
Link: https://qntm.org/mmacevedo
HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26224835


This is a dense speculative-fiction piece presented like an encyclopedia entry about the first “executable” snapshot of a human brain (“MMAcevedo”), captured at sufficient fidelity to run in simulation. The entry explores the technical scale (from near-exabyte raw size to far smaller compressed forms), and how a single canonical scan becomes a reference point for an entire field.

The story leans into second-order consequences: consent and control over copies, economic incentives, “forks” and modified instances, and the ethical ambiguity of deletion, duplication, and repeated execution. It’s written as worldbuilding, but it uses the format to force uncomfortable questions about identity, rights, and exploitation in a world where minds can be copied.

### 4) GPT‑5.3‑Codex‑Spark (openai.com)
Link: https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/
HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46992553


OpenAI announced a research preview of **GPT‑5.3‑Codex‑Spark**, a smaller model tuned for **real-time coding** with very low latency (the post cites >1000 tokens/sec on specialized hardware). The pitch is that interactive editing and tight feedback loops benefit from a different optimization target than long-horizon agentic work.

The post highlights infrastructure changes that reduce end-to-end latency across the stack (including persistent WebSockets and reduced per-token overhead), with an implication that these improvements will carry over to other models. Codex‑Spark launches as text-only with a 128k context window, and with separate rate limits during the preview.

### 5) Monosketch (monosketch.io)
Link: https://monosketch.io/
HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47001871


Monosketch is a browser-based tool for creating diagrams and visual layouts using ASCII/box-drawing characters. The landing page emphasizes building with basic primitives (rectangles, lines, text boxes) and then applying styles to produce presentable, copy-paste-friendly results.

The project is positioned as an open-source alternative for people who want lightweight visuals for docs, demos, and even presentations—especially where embedding images is awkward or where a monospaced, text-native artifact is useful (README files, terminals, code reviews, etc.).

3) **Iodine supp**
- Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1r39y7o/iodine_supp/
- Summary: Summary unavailable (insufficient content in RSS).
- Why it matters:

### r/productivity (top 3)

1) **I finally realized why I was showing up to work already feeling “fried”**
- Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r3o929/i_finally_realized_why_i_was_showing_up_to_work/
- Summary (from RSS content):
  - The author chased “morning hacks” (delayed coffee, cold showers, early wakeups) to fix brain fog.
  - The culprit they identify is the commute: 45 minutes of high-volume phone scrolling.
  - They test a phone ban on the train and report feeling mentally quieter and more organized.
  - They use the time to think/brain-dump priorities instead of consuming feeds.
- Why it matters:
  - “Attention hygiene” earlier in the day can set the tone for the whole work block.
  - Fixes that remove *input* often beat fixes that add more *rituals*.

2) **What file organization tool do you use?**

- Summary (from RSS content):
  - User reports manually-started weightlifting activity not appearing.
  - WHOOP Coach reportedly can’t see activities either.
  - Suggests sync/indexing issues rather than user error.
- Why it matters:
  - Reliability is part of the product: missing sessions break trend interpretation.
  - “Silent failures” are especially costly for users building habits on feedback loops.

3) **118kg → 103kg since getting a WHOOP (Aug 2025)**

## C) Anti-bubble picks (outside the usual sources)

### 1) Archaeology/social theory: the Saxe–Goldstein hypothesis (Wikipedia)
Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxe%E2%80%93Goldstein_hypothesis

- A classic archaeology hypothesis linking **formal burial places (cemeteries, tombs)** to the existence of “corporate groups” that legitimate claims over restricted resources via ancestor ties.
- Useful as a reminder that material practices (where the dead go) can function as “social technology” (how groups justify land, rights, or continuity).
- Also a small case study in how academic ideas rise, spread (processual archaeology), and later get criticized for oversimplification.

### 2) How institutions work (and why “guarding the guardians” can be solvable) (Aeon)
Link: https://aeon.co/essays/institutions-are-how-we-scale-up-cooperation-among-millions

- Frames institutions as **cooperation-amplifying technology**: they don’t remove the need for cooperation, they restructure it into a form that’s monitorable.
- Uses examples like communal forest management in Tokugawa-era Japan (visible monitors + reputational enforcement) to show how hard-to-monitor behavior can become easier to govern.
- A good mental model for modern systems too: shift impossible problems into simpler, observable ones.

### 3) Science + law: are teens “addicted” to social media? (Nature)
Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00433-y

- US courts are starting to treat “social media addiction” as something a jury may need to evaluate, even while researchers debate whether “addiction” is the right clinical term.
- Notes key tension: many studies show correlation with teen mental health trends, but **causation** is harder and evidence is mixed at population level.
- Highlights that “time spent” is a crude metric; different platform activities can plausibly have different effects.
