<div class="prose"><h2>A) Hacker News — Top 5</h2>
<h3>1) Toyota Fluorite: “console-grade” Flutter game engine</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Link:** <a href="https://fluorite.game/">https://fluorite.game/</a></li>
<li>**Domain:** fluorite.game</li>
</ul>
<p>Fluorite is positioning itself as a “console‑grade” 3D game engine that’s tightly integrated with Flutter. The pitch is that you write your gameplay code directly in Dart and build UI using Flutter’s normal widget approach, instead of bolting UI on as a separate layer.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the engine centers on a high‑performance Entity‑Component‑System (ECS) core implemented in C++ for data‑oriented performance, while exposing higher‑level APIs to Dart for day‑to‑day development. It also highlights support for multiple simultaneous 3D scene views via a `FluoriteView` widget and state sharing between entities and UI “the Flutter way,” aiming to keep iteration loops short.</p>
<p>A couple of the more concrete “workflow” features called out: (1) model-defined touch trigger zones so artists can mark clickable regions in Blender that map to tagged events, and (2) hot reload for scenes, leveraging Flutter/Dart to see changes within a couple frames. Rendering is built on Google’s Filament renderer with modern graphics APIs (e.g., Vulkan), plus physically‑based lighting, post‑processing, and custom shaders.</p>
<h3>2) GLM‑5: From Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Link:** <a href="https://z.ai/blog/glm-5">https://z.ai/blog/glm-5</a></li>
<li>**Domain:** z.ai</li>
</ul>
<p>**Note:** I couldn’t fetch the original z.ai blog post content directly (the page returned no extractable content from this environment), so this summary is based on secondary sources and available public references.</p>
<p>Z.ai announced GLM‑5 as a major new model release and framed it as a step from casual “vibe coding” toward “agentic engineering”—i.e., using models as longer‑horizon, tool‑using agents for complex software/system tasks. The name “agentic engineering” is also showing up elsewhere as a label for the craft of building reliable agent workflows rather than just prompting.</p>
<p>A prominent write‑up notes that GLM‑5 is a very large MIT‑licensed model, with artifacts on Hugging Face reported at ~1.51TB, roughly double the size of GLM‑4.7’s distribution. Early anecdotal tests (e.g., structured generation prompts) suggest the release is part model capability and part ecosystem messaging: positioning the model for multi‑step task execution and tool‑mediated development flows.</p>
<h3>3) NetNewsWire Turns 23</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Link:** <a href="https://netnewswire.blog/2026/02/11/netnewswire-turns.html">https://netnewswire.blog/2026/02/11/netnewswire-turns.html</a></li>
<li>**Domain:** netnewswire.blog</li>
</ul>
<p>NetNewsWire’s maintainers mark the 23rd anniversary of the app’s 1.0 release, using the “birthday” moment to give a status update on current work and near‑term plans. They’ve recently shipped NetNewsWire 7.0 for Mac and iOS and are now focused on 7.0.1.</p>
<p>The immediate emphasis is post‑release cleanup: fixing regressions and making quick tweaks that inevitably surface after a major release. They point to a public milestone/to‑do list that tracks the 7.0.1 work in progress.</p>
<p>Looking forward, the roadmap themes are: 7.1 will focus on syncing fixes and improvements; 7.2 is not yet decided (possibly UX polish or a mixed “potpourri”); and anything beyond that depends on what emerges from the 7.1/7.2 cycle and whatever Apple adds to the to‑do list at WWDC. The overall message is “forward‑looking momentum,” not nostalgia.</p>
<h3>4) Claude Code Is Being Dumbed Down</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Link:** <a href="https://symmetrybreak.ing/blog/claude-code-is-being-dumbed-down/">https://symmetrybreak.ing/blog/claude-code-is-being-dumbed-down/</a></li>
<li>**Domain:** symmetrybreak.ing</li>
</ul>
<p>This post argues that a recent Claude Code change removed crucial transparency from the default terminal output: instead of showing *which* files were read and *which* patterns were searched, the tool allegedly now emits generic lines like “Read 3 files” and “Searched for 1 pattern.” The author’s core complaint isn’t about verbosity—it’s about losing actionable, audit‑friendly traces.</p>
<p>A second thread in the critique targets the proposed workaround: “use verbose mode.” The author frames this as an overcorrection: verbose mode can dump too much (thinking traces, transcripts, full file contents), and the user need is narrower—just the file paths and search patterns inline.</p>
<p>The post describes a frustrating product loop: users ask for a simple toggle or revert; the response focuses on reshaping verbose mode instead. The author’s implicit standard is that coding agents should preserve a compact, legible record of what they touched—especially when the tool can spawn multiple sub‑agents and act across a codebase.</p>
<h3>5) Microwave Oven Failure: spontaneously turned on by its LED display (2024)</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Link:** <a href="https://blog.stuffedcow.net/2024/06/microwave-failure-spontaneously-turns-on/">https://blog.stuffedcow.net/2024/06/microwave-failure-spontaneously-turns-on/</a></li>
<li>**Domain:** blog.stuffedcow.net</li>
</ul>
<p>A meticulous teardown story: a microwave began randomly turning on its lamp, fan, and turntable (without cooking), progressively worsening until it was “mostly stuck on.” The obvious suspect—failing door switches—tested fine, pushing the author to dig into the control board and signal logic.</p>
<p>The surprising root cause: an aging LED display. In this design, the same microcontroller GPIO pin is multiplexed to both drive an LED segment and sense a door switch state. As the display aged, reverse‑biased leakage through the LED segment was enough to raise the sensed voltage during the “LEDs off” sampling window, tricking the controller into thinking the door was open.</p>
<p>The repair is elegantly minimal: add a diode to block the reverse leakage current path so the door‑sense line can reliably fall low when the switch is closed. The piece is a useful reminder of how cost‑optimized pin‑sharing and multiplexing can create bizarre, emergent failure modes years later—especially when components drift with age.</p>
<h2>B) Reddit — Top topics (summarized)</h2>
<p>&gt; Note: Reddit HTML/JSON endpoints are often blocked; these summaries are derived from each subreddit’s RSS/Atom feed content. If an entry doesn’t include enough text in RSS, I say so explicitly.</p>
<h3>r/Biohackers (top 3)</h3>
<p>1) **My list of fasting benefits - Updated and ranked by strength of evidence**</p>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1r25y4n/my_list_of_fasting_benefits_updated_and_ranked_by/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1r25y4n/my_list_of_fasting_benefits_updated_and_ranked_by/</a></li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Argues fasting isn’t “casual”: even 2–3 days takes real effort and practice.</li>
<li>Presents an updated list of purported fasting benefits.</li>
<li>Claims the list is evidence‑weighted (mechanistic plausibility, observational data, RCTs, directness).</li>
<li>Notes some benefits move categories with evidence—e.g., autophagy treated as early‑stage due to weak human data.</li>
<li>Uses a color system to distinguish intermittent vs short‑term (≤72h) vs extended (3+ days) fasting.</li>
<li>Why it matters:</li>
<li>Useful template for separating “mechanistically plausible” from “clinically demonstrated.”</li>
<li>Encourages thinking in *protocol dose* (type/duration) rather than fasting as one monolith.</li>
</ul>
<p>2) **Relationship quality as a longevity variable (not romance or recovery)**</p>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1r25qq9/relationship_quality_as_a_longevity_variable_not/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1r25qq9/relationship_quality_as_a_longevity_variable_not/</a></li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Points to longitudinal research linking relationship quality (not merely relationship status) with better health outcomes.</li>
<li>Suggests plausible mechanisms: lower chronic stress load, better recovery behaviors (sleep/consistency).</li>
<li>Notes the inverse: conflict/loneliness may keep stress systems “on.”</li>
<li>Asks the community whether relationships/environment would rank in their top lifestyle factors beyond diet/exercise.</li>
<li>Why it matters:</li>
<li>A nudge to treat “social environment” as a health input you can design, not just a soft variable.</li>
<li>Connects longevity framing with concrete, behavior‑mediating pathways (sleep and consistency).</li>
</ul>
<p>3) **Can creatine affect sleep?**</p>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1r1z6oz/can_creatine_affect_sleep/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1r1z6oz/can_creatine_affect_sleep/</a></li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Describes improved sleep onset after starting evening workouts.</li>
<li>After adding electrolytes + creatine during gym time (evening), reports early morning waking (4–5am) with high energy.</li>
<li>Wonders whether creatine or electrolytes could have a delayed effect ~10 hours later.</li>
<li>Asks about timing: morning creatine + afternoon gym vs “pre/post workout only” folk advice.</li>
<li>Seeks others’ experiences with creatine and sleep disruption.</li>
<li>Why it matters:</li>
<li>Highlights individual variability and the importance of *timing* experiments (training + supplements).</li>
<li>Good candidate for a simple A/B protocol: creatine timing shift, electrolyte brand change, or single-variable removal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>r/blueprint_ (top 3)</h3>
<p>1) **Bryan's Updated 2026 Protocol**</p>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1qm3dk0/bryans_updated_2026_protocol/">https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1qm3dk0/bryans_updated_2026_protocol/</a></li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Shares a motivational framing (“Don’t Die”) and positions adherence as learnable.</li>
<li>Mentions turning the protocol into a “game” to make it more understandable/social.</li>
<li>Emphasizes measurement intensity and prioritizing health as a top life objective.</li>
<li>Links to the full protocol page.</li>
<li>Reads like a canonical/updated reference post for newcomers.</li>
<li>Why it matters:</li>
<li>Establishes the community’s baseline “source of truth” for what’s current vs outdated.</li>
<li>Signals a push toward productized adherence tools (gamification + sharing biomarkers).</li>
</ul>
<p>2) **Blueprint just raised $60M to bring Bryan's longevity protocol to everyone**</p>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1oim0kr/blueprint_just_raised_60m_to_bring_bryans/">https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1oim0kr/blueprint_just_raised_60m_to_bring_bryans/</a></li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Claims Blueprint closed a $60M funding round.</li>
<li>Envisions a comprehensive platform: biomarker tracking, testing, personalized protocols, services (incl. prescription access), and an “AI health companion.”</li>
<li>Names a new CEO and lists a broad investor set.</li>
<li>Mentions hiring across exec/product/engineering and medical leadership.</li>
<li>Frames this as a potential “mainstreaming” moment for structured longevity programs.</li>
<li>Why it matters:</li>
<li>If true, implies a shift from influencer/protocol to scaled consumer health platform.</li>
<li>Raises predictable questions about clinical rigor, compliance, privacy, and how personalization is validated.</li>
</ul>
<p>3) **Does longevity mix have noticeable effects?**</p>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1r20qsh/does_longevity_mix_have_noticeable_effects/">https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/comments/1r20qsh/does_longevity_mix_have_noticeable_effects/</a></li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>User reports taking the mix daily, then pausing for several days.</li>
<li>No clear short‑term subjective difference noticed.</li>
<li>Asks whether benefits are expected only long‑term.</li>
<li>Implicitly asks how to evaluate supplement efficacy beyond vibes.</li>
<li>Invites others’ n=1 reports.</li>
<li>Why it matters:</li>
<li>Good reminder: for many supplements, “feel it” is a poor measurement—needs biomarkers or performance proxies.</li>
<li>Encourages building an evaluation loop (sleep/HRV, labs, cognition tests, training performance) before spending.</li>
</ul>
<h3>r/productivity (top 3)</h3>
<p>1) **Week 3 is where I always quit. So I started keeping receipts. Here's what changed**</p>

<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Describes the “week 3 collapse” pattern in habit building.</li>
<li>Proposes a “Win Log”: write 1–3 things you actually did each day.</li>
<li>Frames it as evidence against negative self‑talk and progress amnesia.</li>
<li>Claims it reframes “bad days” into partial wins and reduces quitting.</li>
<li>Ends with a practical rule: log at least one win daily.</li>
<li>Why it matters:</li>
<li>A lightweight mechanism to counter negativity bias without needing complex trackers.</li>
<li>Works well with behavior change: objective evidence beats motivation spikes.</li>
</ul>
<p>2) **Some small habits I adopted that quietly improved my daily life**</p>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r1uu6t/some_small_habits_i_adopted_that_quietly_improved/">https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r1uu6t/some_small_habits_i_adopted_that_quietly_improved/</a></li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>“Boring” habit stack: delay reactions, keep phone out of reach, start with smallest task.</li>
<li>Emphasizes momentum &gt; motivation.</li>
<li>Suggests reducing over‑explaining and using simple refusals.</li>
<li>Includes daily outdoor time as a mental reset.</li>
<li>Notes that tired scrolling wasn’t relaxing; choosing sleep instead.</li>
<li>Why it matters:</li>
<li>Reinforces that attention and environment design often beat new apps.</li>
<li>These are low‑friction defaults that compound when done daily.</li>
</ul>
<p>3) **why do people always assume the worst tone in short work emails?**</p>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r1synv/why_do_people_always_assume_the_worst_tone_in/">https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r1synv/why_do_people_always_assume_the_worst_tone_in/</a></li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Observes that brief replies (“ok”, “noted”) can be read as cold or passive‑aggressive.</li>
<li>Wonders if it’s missing context, remote work, or over‑interpretation.</li>
<li>Implicitly asks for better norms for terse communication.</li>
<li>Highlights projection in text‑only channels.</li>
<li>Invites discussion on how to reduce misread tone.</li>
<li>Why it matters:</li>
<li>Misread tone is hidden productivity tax: churn, rework, and social friction.</li>
<li>Useful prompt to standardize “neutral acknowledgements” inside teams.</li>
</ul>
<h3>r/whoop (top 3)</h3>
<p>1) **WHOOP add Timers/Alarms!**</p>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1r27oun/whoop_add_timersalarms/">https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1r27oun/whoop_add_timersalarms/</a></li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Requests multiple vibration timers/alarms (beyond wake alarm).</li>
<li>Frames use cases: naps and “don’t forget” reminders.</li>
<li>Emphasizes vibration as a high‑signal, low‑distraction nudge.</li>
<li>Suggests a feature expansion rather than third‑party workarounds.</li>
<li>Simple UX request with obvious utility.</li>
<li>Why it matters:</li>
<li>Wearables are uniquely positioned for “silent reminders” that don’t require screens.</li>
<li>Could directly support adherence behaviors (hydration breaks, cooldown, bedtime routines).</li>
</ul>
<p>2) **Death/Near Death Data??**</p>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1r26lz3/deathnear_death_data/">https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1r26lz3/deathnear_death_data/</a></li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Asks whether anyone has WHOOP data from serious events (accident, heart attack).</li>
<li>Wonders what data looks like near death / at time of death.</li>
<li>Acknowledges the question is morbid but is motivated by curiosity.</li>
<li>Implies interest in physiological signatures and detection.</li>
<li>Opens discussion on limits of consumer wearables in extreme events.</li>
<li>Why it matters:</li>
<li>Highlights a boundary condition for wearables: what they can and can’t meaningfully detect.</li>
<li>Useful for thinking about alerting, false positives, and ethics of health inference.</li>
</ul>
<p>3) **Did they fix weightlifting strains finally?!?**</p>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1r2b6gr/did_they_fix_weightlifting_strains_finally/">https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1r2b6gr/did_they_fix_weightlifting_strains_finally/</a></li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Reports sudden doubling of processed strain scores for similar workouts.</li>
<li>Notes live strain looked normal, but post‑processing increased totals.</li>
<li>Wonders if an algorithm update changed strength training scoring.</li>
<li>Expresses optimism (“finally?!”) that strength effort might be better captured.</li>
<li>Seeks confirmation from other users.</li>
<li>Why it matters:</li>
<li>Scoring changes can break longitudinal comparability unless clearly communicated.</li>

<h2>C) Anti-bubble picks (outside the usual sources)</h2>
<h3>1) Medieval town–gown violence: the St Scholastica Day riot (1355)</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Link:** <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Scholastica_Day_riot">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Scholastica_Day_riot</a></li>
<li>**Source:** Wikipedia (Today’s featured article)</li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Sparked by a dispute over wine quality between Oxford students and a tavernkeeper.</li>
<li>Escalated rapidly into multi‑day violence with armed gangs joining from the countryside.</li>
<li>Resulted in dozens of deaths (townspeople and university members) and a harsh royal response.</li>
<li>Long tail: political power shifted toward the university; later symbolic reconciliation occurred centuries later.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2) On this day: first science fiction on television (1938)</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Link:** <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Selected_anniversaries/February_11">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Selected_anniversaries/February_11</a></li>
<li>**Source:** Wikipedia (On this day)</li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Notes the BBC’s 1938 adaptation of a section of Karel Čapek’s *R.U.R.* as the first TV science fiction broadcast.</li>
<li>A neat historical anchor for how quickly new media forms adopt speculative storytelling.</li>
<li>Reminds that “sci‑fi as a lens on tech anxiety” is as old as broadcast media.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3) Solarpunk as a design stance: “Compost modernity!”</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Link:** <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/in-solarpunk-cities-of-the-future-tech-follows-natures-lead">https://aeon.co/essays/in-solarpunk-cities-of-the-future-tech-follows-natures-lead</a></li>
<li>**Source:** Aeon</li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Presents solarpunk as an optimistic counter‑aesthetic: technology integrated with ecology and civic inclusion.</li>
<li>Argues for “nature‑led” tech—designing systems that follow biological constraints instead of fighting them.</li>
<li>Useful if you want climate/urban futures that aren’t just dystopia vs techno‑utopia.</li>
</ul>
