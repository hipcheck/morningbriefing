<div class="prose"><h2>Hacker News — Top 5</h2>
<h3>1) Toyota Fluorite: “console-grade” Flutter game engine</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Domain:** fluorite.game</li>
<li>**Link:** <a href="https://fluorite.game/">https://fluorite.game/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Fluorite is positioned as a “console‑grade” 3D game engine that’s tightly integrated with Flutter—meaning you can write game logic in **Dart** while still building UI with Flutter widgets. The pitch is that you keep the Flutter developer workflow (including familiar tooling) while gaining a high‑performance 3D runtime.</p>
<p>Under the hood, Fluorite describes a **data‑oriented ECS (Entity‑Component‑System)** core implemented in **C++** for performance and embedded/lower‑end hardware friendliness. Rendering is powered by **Google’s Filament** and modern graphics APIs (e.g., Vulkan). It also highlights workflow features like **hot reload for scenes**, and a neat creator‑friendly feature where artists can define **touch/click trigger zones in Blender** that map to in‑game events.</p>
<h3>2) GLM-5: From Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Domain:** z.ai</li>
<li>**Link:** <a href="https://z.ai/blog/glm-5">https://z.ai/blog/glm-5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>**Fetch note:** I wasn’t able to retrieve the z.ai blog post content from this environment (the page returned no extractable content), so the summary below is based on accessible secondary sources.</p>
<p>Z.ai appears to be framing **GLM‑5** as a major step up in scale and capability, and (notably) is trying to popularize the term **“agentic engineering”** as the professional framing for software engineers building with LLMs/agents. That naming matters because it signals where the vendor thinks the value is: less “prompting” and more **long‑horizon system building** with autonomous components.</p>
<p>A widely-linked write‑up notes this is a **very large MIT‑licensed model** (on the order of ~754B parameters) with a correspondingly massive distribution footprint on Hugging Face. The piece also ties the “agentic engineering” label to recent public uses of that term by Andrej Karpathy and Addy Osmani.</p>
<h3>3) NetNewsWire Turns 23</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Domain:** netnewswire.blog</li>
<li>**Link:** <a href="https://netnewswire.blog/2026/02/11/netnewswire-turns.html">https://netnewswire.blog/2026/02/11/netnewswire-turns.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>NetNewsWire hit its 23rd birthday and the team used the milestone as a short “where we are / where we’re going” update. They’ve just shipped **NetNewsWire 7.0 for Mac and iOS** and are now working on **7.0.1** to address regressions and quick-turn tweaks that tend to surface after major releases.</p>
<p>The roadmap notes **7.1** will focus on **syncing fixes and improvements**, while **7.2** doesn’t have a single focus yet (could be polish/UX or a mixed “potpourri”). They also emphasize that milestones are fluid and will change—especially with WWDC potentially adding new constraints/opportunities.</p>
<h3>4) Claude Code Is Being Dumbed Down</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Domain:** symmetrybreak.ing</li>
<li>**Link:** <a href="https://symmetrybreak.ing/blog/claude-code-is-being-dumbed-down/">https://symmetrybreak.ing/blog/claude-code-is-being-dumbed-down/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The author argues that a recent Claude Code release replaced previously detailed action logs (e.g., which files were read, what patterns were searched) with vague summaries like “Read 3 files” and “Searched for 1 pattern,” removing information that helped users audit what the tool is doing. The complaint is that this reduces the product’s usefulness precisely when developers most need transparency.</p>
<p>The piece also criticizes the suggested workaround (“use verbose mode”) as the wrong tool: users want **specific missing context** (file paths + search patterns) rather than a firehose of additional noise (thinking traces, subagent transcripts, etc.). The author’s core claim is that a simple configuration toggle would address the issue with less disruption.</p>
<h3>5) Microwave Oven Failure: spontaneously turned on by its LED display (2024)</h3>
<ul>
<li>**Domain:** blog.stuffedcow.net</li>
<li>**Link:** <a href="https://blog.stuffedcow.net/2024/06/microwave-failure-spontaneously-turns-on/">https://blog.stuffedcow.net/2024/06/microwave-failure-spontaneously-turns-on/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A microwave that seems to “turn on by itself” is a classic story that makes people think “door switch failure” (and worry about safety). This teardown traces a real failure mode where the oven’s lamp/fan/turntable would randomly run, while the magnetron remained off—still alarming, but not the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>The root cause is delightfully cursed: an aging **LED display**. The control board shares a microcontroller GPIO pin between **driving a display segment** and **sensing the door switch**. As the LEDs age, reverse leakage becomes high enough to change the sensed voltage on that shared pin, tricking the microcontroller into thinking the door is open even when it’s closed. The author documents the circuit, scope traces, and a practical fix (adding a diode to block leakage), plus a later full display replacement when other segments began interfering with keypad scanning too.</p>

<li>**My list of fasting benefits - Updated and ranked by strength of evidence** — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1r25y4n/my_list_of_fasting_benefits_updated_and_ranked_by/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1r25y4n/my_list_of_fasting_benefits_updated_and_ranked_by/</a></li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Recently I saw a post about extended fasting.</li>
<li>As a big proponent of fasting, I’d like to add a couple of points.</li>
<li>First, fasting requires effort, it's not a casual thing.</li>
<li>Even a short-term fast of 2-3 days takes a solid effort to make it happen.</li>
<li>Though with practice, it becomes quite doable.</li>
<li>For some people, it’s an unachievable goal, but for others it’s a weekly routine.</li>
<li>Why it matters:</li>
<li>Turn anecdotes into a better experiment template: define the change, measure outcomes, watch confounders (sleep, caffeine, electrolytes).</li>

<li>Summary:</li>
<li>We might be the first generation that doesn't die.</li>
<li>To that end, my team and I have spent the last few years building the world's first Don't Die protocol.</li>

<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Big news dropped today that I wanted to share with you all: Blueprint just closed a $60 million funding round.</li>
<li>TLDR: Bryan Johnson's longevity protocol is about to become accessible to the general public through a comprehensive platform.</li>
<li>This could be a pretty significant moment for the biohacking/longevity space.</li>
<li>They're building out a full-service platform that includes:</li>
<li>Blood testing and biomarker tracking</li>
<li>Food delivery, GLP-1 access, prescription services</li>

<li>Summary:</li>
<li>I’m just about to finish my second bag of it and honestly I have no idea if it’s working.</li>
<li>I’ve taken it every day until about 2 weeks ago and then took like 4 days off and felt no noticeable difference though I wasn’t paying close attention.</li>
<li>Or, is it solely supposed to help in the “long” term?</li>

<h2>Anti-bubble picks (outside the usual sources)</h2>

<li>Summary:</li>
<li>A dispute over the quality of wine escalated into a three‑day riot between Oxford townspeople and university members.</li>
<li>Dozens were killed (sources vary), and the Crown ultimately sided with the university.</li>
<li>The settlement increased university powers at the town’s expense—an early example of how institutions can lock in privileges after conflict.</li>
<li>A 600th‑anniversary reconciliation gesture in 1955 symbolically reversed roles (honorary degree / freeman status).</li>

<li>Summary:</li>
<li>A tour of “solarpunk” as a design philosophy: technology that follows ecological constraints rather than overriding them.</li>
<li>Emphasizes aesthetics + governance: inclusive, communal, and materially grounded futures (not just shiny gadgets).</li>
<li>Useful as a counterweight to “more tech = better” narratives—forces you to ask what a *good* future feels like day‑to‑day.</li>

<h3>3) Quanta Magazine: Physicists make electrons flow like water</h3>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-make-electrons-flow-like-water-20260211/">https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-make-electrons-flow-like-water-20260211/</a></li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>In ordinary conductors, electricity doesn’t behave like a coherent fluid—even though we talk about “current flow.”</li>
<li>Experimental setups can induce regimes where electrons collectively act more like a liquid, opening different ways to reason about transport.</li>
<li>This “electron hydrodynamics” line of work can illuminate strongly interacting quantum systems, and may create new measurement/engineering primitives.</li>
