- Built and published GitHub Pages-based Morning Briefing site (dark-first theme, magenta/purple accents, dark/light toggle).
- Updated morning briefing cron to publish daily posts and post a Slack link; expanded HN summaries spec.
- Integrated Readwise: saved API token locally on VPS in `secrets/readwise_token.txt` (gitignored). Updated briefing cron to add "For you (anti-bubble picks)" section based on ALL highlights.
- Deep-dive Readwise scan (caps): fetched ~5,000 highlights and 1,332 books to derive an interest profile for recommendations.
